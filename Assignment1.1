What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
ANS:This is performed on multiple vectors of different sizes. R takes the shorter vector and repeats them until it becomes long enough to match the longer one.

Give an example of recycling of elements?
EX: ABC<- c(1,2,3,4)
    DEF<- c(1,2)
    Z<-ABC*DEF
    Output:
   [1] 1 4 3 8
